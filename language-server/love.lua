---Adjust the frequency components of the sound using a 4-band (low-shelf, two band-pass and a high-shelf) equalizer.
---| "equalizer"
---Plays two copies of the sound; while varying the phase, or equivalently delaying one of them, by amounts on the order of milliseconds, resulting in phasing sounds.
---| "flanger"
---Decaying feedback based effect, on the order of milliseconds. Used to simulate the reflection off of the surroundings.

---The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.
---
---LÖVE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.
---
---In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.
---
---Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.

end

---Draws a Drawable object (an Image, Canvas, SpriteBatch, ParticleSystem, Mesh, Text object, or Video) on the screen with optional rotation, scaling and shearing.
---
---Objects are drawn relative to their local coordinate system. The origin is by default located at the top left corner of Image and Canvas. All scaling, shearing, and rotation arguments transform the object relative to that point. Also, the position of the origin can be specified on the screen coordinate system.
---
---It's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation. One can also use a negative scaling factor to flip about its centerline. 
---
---Note that the offsets are applied before rotation, scaling, or shearing; scaling and shearing are applied before rotation.
---
---The right and bottom edges of the object are shifted at an angle defined by the shearing factors.
---

---Gets whether gamma-correct rendering is supported and enabled. It can be enabled by setting t.gammacorrect = true in love.conf.
---
---Not all devices support gamma-correct rendering, in which case it will be automatically disabled and this function will return false. It is supported on desktop systems which have graphics cards that are capable of using OpenGL 3 / DirectX 10, and iOS devices that can use OpenGL ES 3.
---
---When gamma-correct rendering is enabled, many functions and objects perform automatic color conversion between sRGB and linear RGB in order for blending and shader math to be mathematically correct (which they aren't if it's not enabled.)
---
---* The colors passed into converted from sRGB to linear RGB.
---
---* The colors set in text with per-character colors, points with per-point colors, standard custom Meshes which use the 'VertexColor' attribute name will automatically be converted from sRGB to linear RGB when those objects are drawn.
---
---* creating the Image.
---
---* Everything drawn to the screen will be blended in linear RGB and then the result will be converted to sRGB for display.
---
---* Canvases which use the 'normal' or 'srgb' CanvasFormat will have their content blended in linear RGB and the result will be stored in the canvas in sRGB, when drawing to them. When the Canvas itself is drawn, its pixel colors will be converted from sRGB to linear RGB in the same manner as Images. Keeping the canvas pixel data stored as sRGB allows for better precision (less banding) for darker colors compared to 'rgba8'.
---
---Because most conversions are automatically handled, your own code doesn't need to worry about sRGB and linear RGB color conversions when gamma-correct rendering is enabled, except in a couple cases:
---
---* If a Mesh with custom vertex attributes is used and one of the attributes is meant to be used as a color in a Shader, and the attribute isn't named 'VertexColor'.
---
---* If  a Shader is used which has uniform / extern variables or other variables that are meant to be used as colors, and Shader:sendColor isn't used.
---
---In both cases, love.math.gammaToLinear can be used to convert color values to linear RGB in Lua code, or the gammaCorrectColor (or unGammaCorrectColor if necessary) shader functions can be used inside shader code. Those shader functions ''only'' do conversions if gamma-correct rendering is actually enabled. The LOVE_GAMMA_CORRECT shader preprocessor define will be set if so.

---Creates a new array Image.
---
---An array image / array texture is a single object which contains multiple 'layers' or 'slices' of 2D sub-images. It can be thought of similarly to a texture atlas or sprite sheet, but it doesn't suffer from the same tile / quad bleeding artifacts that texture atlases do – although every sub-image must have the same dimensions.
---
---A specific layer of an array image can be drawn with love.graphics.drawLayer / SpriteBatch:addLayer, or with the Quad variant of love.graphics.draw and Quad:setLayer, or via a custom Shader.
---
---To use an array image in a Shader, it must be declared as a ArrayImage or sampler2DArray type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(ArrayImage image, vec3 texturecoord) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from a slice of the array image. The vec3 argument contains the texture coordinate in the first two components, and the 0-based slice index in the third component.
---
---Creates an array Image given a different image file for each slice of the resulting array image object.
---
---Illustration of how an array image works: [http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/dec/09/minecraft-like-rendering-experiments-in-opengl-4/illustrations/textures.jpg]
---
---A DPI scale of 2 (double the normal pixel density) will result in the image taking up the same space on-screen as an image with half its pixel dimensions that has a DPI scale of 1. This allows for easily swapping out image assets that take the same space on-screen but have different pixel densities, which makes supporting high-dpi / retina resolution require less code logic.
---
---In order to use an Array Texture or other non-2D texture types as the main texture in a custom void effect() variant must be used in the pixel shader, and MainTex must be declared as an ArrayImage or sampler2DArray like so: uniform ArrayImage MainTex;.

---
---Shaders are small programs which are run on the graphics card when drawing. Vertex shaders are run once for each vertex (for example, an image has 4 vertices - one at each corner. A Mesh might have many more.) Pixel shaders are run once for each pixel on the screen which the drawn object touches. Pixel shader code is executed after all the object's vertices have been processed by the vertex shader.

---Creates a new volume (3D) Image.
---
---Volume images are 3D textures with width, height, and depth. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a volume image in a Shader, it must be declared as a VolumeImage or sampler3D type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(VolumeImage image, vec3 texcoords) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the volume image. The vec3 argument is a normalized texture coordinate with the z component representing the depth to sample at (ranging from 1).
---
---Volume images are typically used as lookup tables in shaders for color grading, for example, because sampling using a texture coordinate that is partway in between two pixels can interpolate across all 3 dimensions in the volume image, resulting in a smooth gradient even when a small-sized volume image is used as the lookup table.
---
---Array images are a much better choice than volume images for storing multiple different sprites in a single array image for directly drawing them.
---
---Creates a volume Image given multiple image files with matching dimensions.
---
---Volume images are not supported on some older mobile devices. Use love.graphics.getTextureTypes to check at runtime.

---
---@param angle number The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians.
function love.graphics.rotate(angle)

---Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---By default the coordinate system in LÖVE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.
---
---After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.

---Keyboard scancodes.
---
---Scancodes are keyboard layout-independent, so the scancode "w" will be generated if the key in the same place as the "w" key on an American QWERTY keyboard is pressed, no matter what the key is labelled or what the user's operating system settings are.
---
---Using scancodes, rather than keycodes, is useful because keyboards with layouts differing from the US/UK layout(s) might have keys that generate 'unknown' keycodes, but the scancodes will still be detected. This however would necessitate having a list for each keyboard layout one would choose to support.
---
---One could use textinput or textedited instead, but those only give back the end result of keys used, i.e. you can't get modifiers on their own from it, only the final symbols that were generated.

---
---There are two methods to check for body collisions:
---
---*  at their location when the world is updated (default)
---
---*  using continuous collision detection (CCD)
---
---The default method is efficient, but a body moving very quickly may sometimes jump over another body without producing a collision. A body that is set as a bullet will use CCD. This is less efficient, but is guaranteed not to jump when moving quickly.
---
---Note that static bodies (with zero mass) always use CCD, so your walls will not let a fast moving body pass through even if it is not a bullet.

---Allows you to work with threads.
---
---Threads are separate Lua environments, running in parallel to the main code. As their code runs separately, they can be used to compute complex operations without adversely affecting the frame rate of the main thread. However, as they are separate environments, they cannot access the variables and functions of the main thread, and communication between threads is limited.
---
---All LOVE objects (userdata) are shared among threads so you'll only have to send their references across threads. You may run into concurrency issues if you manipulate an object on multiple threads at the same time.

---
---* If fullscreen is enabled and the width or height is not supported (see resize event will be triggered.
---
---* If the fullscreen type is 'desktop', then the window will be automatically resized to the desktop resolution.
---
---* If the width and height is bigger than or equal to the desktop dimensions (this includes setting both to 0) and fullscreen is set to false, it will appear 'visually' fullscreen, but it's not true fullscreen and conf.lua (i.e. t.window = false) and use this function to manually create the window, then you must not call any other love.graphics.* function before this one. Doing so will result in undefined behavior and/or crashes because OpenGL cannot function properly without a window.

---Converts a number from density-independent units to pixels.
---
---The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.toPixels(800) would return 1600 in that case.
